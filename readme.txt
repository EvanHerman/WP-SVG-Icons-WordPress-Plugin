I originally created this plugin for my own personal use on client projects. After witnessing the power of this plugin first hand, I wanted to give a little something back to the community who have helped me through the years. The 'WordPress SVG Icon Set' is extremely easy for any one to use. Two clicks of the mouse and you have an icon ready to be placed on to your site. These icons are a set of web-fonts, and are extremely scale-able. Meaning they will not degrade in quality the larger they get. Another great feature of this plugin is the ability to use the same icons across all devices. No need to generate Retina specific images for mobile devices. By setting a max-width on the icon, it then becomes responsive. This plugin is also great for developers who use icons on multiple sites and want to avoid the hassle of re-installing
web fonts on to a new server every time. With this plugin its one click and you're ready to begin working. You can use these any where in your themes.

**Special Thanks Goes To:**

* [IcoMoon](http://www.icomoon.io) for an amazing base set of free icon's for use, many in this plugin.
* [Alessio Atzeni](http://www.alessioatzeni.com/) for the inclusion of a few 'Metoicons' icons in this plugin.
* [PJ Onori](http://somerandomdude.com) for the inclusion of a few 'Iconic' icons in this plugin.

**and of course**

* [Matt Mullenweg](http://www.ma.tt/) for everything he does for the WordPress community. Without him none of this would be possible.


*Developing plugins is long and tedious work. If you benefit or enjoy this plugin please take the time to rate and review it, as this will only make future iterations of it better.*

== Installation ==

<strong>Installation</strong>

1. Upload `wordpress-svg-icons-plugin.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'WP SVG Icon' plugin page in the dashboard
4. Click on which icon you would like to use
5. A preview of the icon will then appear in the preview box at the top. You can either copy the generated shortcode, or click on 'Insert Icon' (if on the post or page edit screens)
6. Keep in mind, you can also use the shortcode in widgets or anywhere else on your site. If the shortcode isn't suitable for your needs, consider using the generated HTML instead.

<hr />

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need some help! What's the best way to go about getting support? =

Please consider <a href="https://www.evan-herman.com/wp-svg-icons-pro/" target="_blank">purchasing the premium version</a> of the plugin if you require support. The idea behind the free version was to give something back to the community. Constantly iterating and supporting a free plugin is time consuming and not sustainable.

With the premium version you're guaranteed a level of support you wouldn't otherwise get. You'll receive top notch support from a full-time and professional WordPress developer.

If your not interested in purchasing the premium version, please <a href="https://www.evan-herman.com/wordpress-support/" target="_blank">register for support on my site</a>. Once registered please post in the respective forum and I will get back to you as time permits. Pro version holders ger priority access to support.

= Will these icons loose quality as they scale up? =

No. These icons are not .png or .jpg format. They are .svg (scalable vector graphics), which means you can scale them as large as you want with out any loss in quality. (really....as large as you want!)

= Can you change the color of the icons? =

Yes, by adding the 'color' parameter to the shortcode, and then specifying either a hex, rgb or rgba color code.
For example :
`[wp-svg-icons icon="menu-2" wrap="i" color="#B4DA55"]`

= What's different between the free and the pro version? =

The pro version comes with a pretty sweet icon customizer. Not only does this allow you to adjust the size, color and link attribute but it allows you to easily customize your icon without ever needing to remember any of the shortcode parameters or write a single line of code!

The pro version also comes with custom nav walkers implemented, to easily add icons to any of your menu items. This is a neat little feature which allows you to select an icon from a dropdown to assign to your menu directly from within the menu edit screen.

If you buy the pro version you will also receive support and updates for one year, for those times you need to make something out of the ordinary happen.

== Usage Instructions ==

You have two possible avenues for using the plugin. Head over to the main 'Default Icon Set' page to generate a shortcode for your icon, or click the 'Add Icon' button from the post or page editor.

The icon shortcode will look like the following:

`[wp-svg-icons icon="pencil-2" wrap="span"]`

Custom icons utilize 'custom_icon' parameter instead of 'icon'.

It is also extremely simple to change the size of the icon. You can either change the element that the icon is housed in (h1,h2,h3 etc.) or you can utilize the 'size' shortcode parameter.

*Example:*

`[wp-svg-icons icon="menu-2" wrap="i" size="3em"]`

The above shortcode will set the icon size to 3em. You may also specify 'px', '%' or 'rem' as the font size.

Additionally you can easily change the icon color as well, using the 'color' parameter.

*Example:*

`[wp-svg-icons icon="menu-2" wrap="i" color="#2ECC4B"]`

You may also use hex, rgb or rgba values.

*Example:*
`[wp-svg-icons icon="menu-2" wrap="i" color="rgba(45, 223, 78, 0.28)"]`

The above two example shortcodes would set the color of the icon to a light green.

Additionally you can add custom classes to your icon through the use of the class shortcode parameter.

*Example:*
`[wp-svg-icons icon="menu-2" wrap="i" class="custom-icon icon-class testing-custom-icon-class"]`

The resulting HTML would look like :
`<i class="wp-svg-menu-2 custom-icon icon-class testing-custom-icon-class"></i>`

Adding custom classes to your icon allows you to more easily target singular icons via CSS. This is helpful for adding hover fades, or simple CSS animations to an icon.

*All Shortcode Parameters:*

* icon - the name of the icon you want this shortcode to generate
* wrap - set the element your icon will be housed in (div, span, h1, h2 etc.)
* class - assign additional classes to your icon. awesome for targeting your icons more easily.
* size - alter the size of the icon regardless of the container (px, em, rem, %)
* icon - assign a default icon
* custom_icon - assign a custom icon
* link - link the icon to a page or post
* new_tab - open the link in a new tab
* color - alter the color of the icon (hex, rgb, rgba)

**Icomoon Icon Font Importer**

*Note:* The number of custom icons allowed in the free version is limited to 10 icons. If you require more than 10 custom icons on your site, please <a href="https://www.evan-herman.com/wp-svg-icons-pro/" title="Upgrade Now!">upgrade to the pro version</a> to allow for an un-restricted number of icons to be used on your site.
