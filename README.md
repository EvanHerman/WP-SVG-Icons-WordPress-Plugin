== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Will these plugins loose quality as they scale up? =

No. These icons are not .png or .jpg format. They are .svg (scalable vector graphics), which means you can scale them

as large as you want with out any loss in quality.


= Can you change the color of the icons? =

Yes, by specificying an inline color property to the div. 


= Can you add animations to the icons? =

Yes, but you will need to know how to add CSS3 animations. The plugin does not come with any prebuilt animation.

This icon set comes with a few good loader icons just for this purpose.
